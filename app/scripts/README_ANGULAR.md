# Angular app

### External libraries

* Ui router / Standard replacement for angular router that deal with states
* JS Data / Store and share data between controllers in a more efficient way 
* ngMessages / Handle validation message for form validation

### Best pratices used 

* Controller as syntax 
* this vs $scope


### JS Data and Data handling 

JS data allow : 
* To define the relations between all objects of the app 
* Make the mounting of objects with their related object (raw objects are sideloaded)
* Search loaded data from everywhere (controller, tremplates, services....)
*  Make verification of the data syntax (WIP)
*  Make automatic API call with standard REST API syntax (partial implementation due to a limitation of js Data lib that will be fixed in 2.0 release)
